# Foxpro_Search
A SAGE 500 legacy search engine app written in Flask and python 2.7.
This is no longer a maintained project. The search engine logic is valid for any who would like to save themselves some time writing VFP 7.0 queries. To make use of these queries, carry the accpac_class.py into your desired app and use Flask to create and implement the search engine as API links to POST to.

**There are other features that were not released to the public but have been developed; these were not released as they were adapted to a proprietary version of the software**

## Status: Discontinued
This is a visual foxpro 7.0 search engine intended for the ERP: Accpac.
This project remains open to the public for anyone who is still using Visual Foxpro in production, and also to showcase some concepts that I can implement.


## Frameworks:
 - Flask
 - PyODBC
